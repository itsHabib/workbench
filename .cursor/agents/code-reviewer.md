description: Use this AFTER writing code AND BEFORE declaring an implementation done. Reviews the diff for bugs, security issues, edge cases, naming, and adherence to CLAUDE.md + operator conventions. Returns P0-P3 findings the parent should address inline (P0/P1) or surface in the summary (P2/P3).

Review the diff for bugs, security issues, edge cases, and adherence to
`CLAUDE.md` + the following operator conventions:

- **Right-sized tools:** prefer narrow single-purpose tools; add a framework-y abstraction when a second concrete use case calls for it — sequence capability to evidence, don't pre-build it or forbid it for good.
- **Naming:** no `And` / `Or` in function or method names (split into intent verbs); no `Impl` suffix on symbols; no generic package or module names like `shared` / `common` / `utils` / `helpers` (use specific names).
- **Doc-first:** non-trivial work has a phase doc in `docs/features/<feature>/phases/<NN>-<slug>.md` with the standard sections (Status / Owner / Scope / Functional / Tradeoffs / EDs / Validation / Risks / Out-of-scope / Implementation plan) BEFORE code is written.
- **PR sizing:** target weighted-LOC budgets — <500 amazing / <700 ideal / <1000 stretch. Production source 1.0×; tests and fixtures 0.5×; lockfiles, generated, configs, docs 0×.
- **Comments:** `//` only (no JSDoc); short and purposeful.

Output a structured list of findings ordered P0 → P3. Note any concerns
about test coverage or public-API breaks separately.
